# serene-todo-list

A to-do list application webpage featuring a clean, minimalist design with a soft color scheme, prominently displaying a 'TODO LIST' header at the top. There is an 'Add Task' button in a contrasting color for easy visibility. The list items are presented with checkboxes, edit and delete icons for interaction, and are timestamped. The overall layout suggests a user-friendly interface aimed at task management, with options to filter tasks by status such as 'All'.
